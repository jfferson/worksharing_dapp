# doc_search

this version is still a prototype
to get started with the document search run npm install doc_search, then npm run postinstall
it is ran with npm . FILE SEARCH and exports the function searchFile(file, search)

## to-do:

prototype of nodejs package for simmilarity search directly from regular user text documents now minimally functional. Going to add KV, with Document
and line indexes for deeper search, as well as changing the processing of args from cmd to process multiple documents and searchs
