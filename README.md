## to-do:

write a package for simmilarity search directly from regular user text documents.
The best packages providing the funcionalities for achieving it are Apache Tika, for handling the documents and flexsearch, for the simmilarity search.
On my latest attempt I was trying to use primarilly nodejs for the package, however with the lack of success on integrating Java, with well defined behaviour, I may instead change it to a Java or Python package integrating nodejs
